# Franka_Robot

This repository contains the implementation and results of my Master’s thesis. 

## Aim
1. To analyze the performance of **NVIDIA cuMotion** motion planning algorithms.
2. To integrate **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** (a physics-based simulation platform) with **ROS2** (a robotics middleware framework).

## Background

**cuMotion (or cuRobo)** is a CUDA-accelerated library developed by NVIDIA. It provides a suite of robotics algorithms that leverage parallel computation to improve performance.

The project uses **Isaac Sim** as a simulation platform to manipulate the **Franka Panda** robot via the **ROS2 middleware**. The **Isaac Sim** environment is configured with the **ROS2 bridge package** through the `omni.isaac.ros2_bridge` extension. Within this environment:
- An **Action Graph**  facilitates communication with ROS2.
- **Action Graph construction** is visualized in Figure below.
![Figure 1: Action Graph Construction](<Franka_Robot/images/Action_Graph_Panda.png>)

Two robots are utilized in the project:
1. **Franka Panda** for manipulation tasks.
2. **Idealworks iw.hub** robot for mobile platform tasks.

## Benchmarking Scenarios

The project evaluates the performance of the **cuMotion** pipeline against the **OMPL** pipeline in three scenarios. Each scenario involves the robot moving from a collision-free initial state(IS) to intermediate(IT) and final target(FT) states.

### 1. Narrow Tunnel
- **Setup**: Targets are placed on either side of a narrow tunnel.
- **Objective**: The robot can either navigate from **IS** through the tunnel or avoid it to reach the **IT** and **FT** pose.

### 2. Library Scene
- **Setup**: A scene with a bookshelf and a table, with the robot positioned between them.
- **Objective**:
  - Move from **IS**  to the top shelf (**IT**).
  - Proceed under the table (**FT**).

### 3. Factory Scene
- **Setup**: A rack and two containers define the scene.
- **Objective**:
  - Move from the **IS** to the middle section of the rack (**IT**).
  - Proceed to the first container (**FT**).

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the motion planning pipelines is analyzed using the following metrics:

1. **C-Space Path Length**: 
   - The length of the path traversed in configuration space.
   
2. **Mean Velocity**:
   - The average speed of the robot's end-effector or a point of interest along the path.

3. **Maximum Acceleration**:
   - The highest rate of change of velocity along the planned path.

4. **Maximum Jerk**:
   - The maximum rate of change of acceleration.

5. **Full Pipeline Time**:
   - The total time from the start of motion planning to the completion of the path execution.

Each planner and planning scene is tested over **5 iterations**. The planned trajectories are visualized in **RViz**, while the robot's motion is observed in **Isaac Sim**.

## Results and Discussion

It is observed that **cuMotion** produces shorter paths compared to **OMPL** across all scenes. On average, **cuMotion** reduces the path length by —% when compared to **OMPL**, as shown in **Figure 4**.

![Figure 4: Configuration Space](<Franka_Robot/images/C Space.png>)

The maximum jerk along the trajectory across all joints and scenes is shown in **Figure 5**. The results indicate that the maximum jerk experienced with **cuMotion** is — times lower than that of **OMPL**.

![Figure 5: Jerk Analysis](<Franka_Robot/images/Jerk.png>)

As shown in **Figure 6**, the average time **cuMotion** takes to plan and produce trajectories, as well as execute robot motions, is **1.53 times lower** compared to **OMPL**.

![Figure 6: Time Analysis](<Franka_Robot/images/Full Time.png>)

**OMPL** exhibits the highest maximum acceleration values compared to **cuMotion**. As visualized in **Figure 7**, trajectories generated by **cuMotion** show an average **50% lower maximum acceleration** than those generated by **OMPL**.

![Figure 7: Acceleration Analysis](<Franka_Robot/images/Acceleration.png>)

Even with the smallest maximum acceleration, **cuMotion** achieves a mean velocity comparable to **OMPL**, as shown in **Figure 8**. The mean velocity produced by **cuMotion** is slightly higher by **0.01 rad/s** on average, and **1.35 times higher** compared to **OMPL**.
